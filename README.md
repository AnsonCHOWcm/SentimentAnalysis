# SentimentAnalysis

This is a mini Project from my Nano Degree (Deep Learning) in Udacity

The Sentiment contains the source code of the model (this is a MLP (1 hidden layer))

The Sentiment_Analysis is the main code source for executing the training and testing

The notebook (Sentiment_Analysis_Projects) is the description of the project with different stages
